### Dev.initialise()
Welcome to the world of development! Enough formalities...

It's time you falsified some of the Memes about what people think Software Engineers do and what you actually do.  
Time for them Terminals; your best bud to-be.

Sadly terminals need an OS to run on (bummer) and as we at ODIN are obsessed with Open-Source softwares, you've got to try out [Linux](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/what-is-linux).  
We suggest everyone who intends to do development to give any Linux distribution a try. You will definitely be surprised by how efficient things can be for us devs through a terminal.

One may find OSX as an option as well for setting up development environments(OSX is pretty badass),  
but then many Linux distros are **FREE**.  
So, if you want to shell out **some** bucks on an Apple product, go for it!  
The debate for OSX vs Linux makes for many interesting reads, as you might find it [here](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2947684/linux/os-x-versus-linux-which-is-more-practical.html).

##### Let's get them Linux distros
Due to the open-sourced nature of the Linux kernel, it's raining distributions out there. So many forks and flavours.  
All this may overwhelm a person trying to get into operating a Linux distro.  
Depending on how much comfortable you are(read "Swag Level") and your requirements, [this article on lifehacker.com](http://lifehacker.com/5773667/pick-the-right-linux-flavor-for-you) sheds some light on the most popular distros available.  
Personally, [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop) is the best bet for getting a balanced Linux experience and is not at all uneasy for people used to Windows.
